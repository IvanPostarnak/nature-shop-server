# TODOs
- [ ] To create a common Error() object, to invoke similar error messages easily
- [ ] To attach testing scripts for whole server
  - [X] helpers/ functions
- [ ] To solve comming issues with security: add an area check (check of source of request)
- [ ] To wrap whole server in the docker container
- [ ] To create an abstraction for tables, or somehow bound tables' columns and query params. There is a problem with 'configureTableQuery()' method - it is too much specific: I tried to add 'ratingQuery' middleware to 'shops/?rating=' route, but this config function checks only 'rating_5' rating column... so we need to make it less specific
- [ ] To add try-catch block for request to dictionary in Postgresql class (right now there is a possibility to abort whole process if there is a misstake to querying dictionary)
- [ ] To extract repeating try-catch blocks from constrollers into common method (refactor)
- [X] To add a client-side query param 'method=or/and' to configure how to combine other query params
- [ ] To add docs/requests/purchases/ folder and .md request files, related to this route
